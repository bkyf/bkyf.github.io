                                        As part of my appointment as a Research Assistant at the University of Glasgow,
                                        I had to evaluate and redesign a mobile phone reminder tool for people with 
                                        memory impairments - due to acquired brain injury. 
                                        The main feature of the application was the ability to 
                                        provide unsolicited prompts to users for the input of new reminders, in case 
                                        they forgot to.

                                        <br>
                                        This application had been collaboratively designed by researchers in Human-Computer Interaction
                                        and Applied Neuropsychology. It was then developed for smartphones (Android & iPhone)
                                        by a contractor company.

                                        <br>
                                        My role at this project was to evaluate the application and redesign
                                        it according to the needs of the users. Also, I was responsible for
                                        communicate the designs and requirements to the contractor company
                                        and overlook the implementation in regards to usability.
                                        Lastly, I was responsible for exploring potential commercialisation
                                        routes and business cases for the application.

                                    <h3 id="background">Methodology</h3>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        In order to evaluate the application and refine it we conducted an evaluation
                                        and a requirements gathering workshop with carers and people with
                                        memory impairments due to acquired brain injury.
                                    </p>   
                                    
                                    <h4 id="design">Requirements Gathering Workshop</h4>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>
                                        This workshop was conducted in order to get a deeper understanding of the 
                                        users. Even though previous work was conducted by the research team to understand
                                        the users, there were still insights missing on perceived usefulness of 
                                        the application.
                                        <br>
                                        Hence, I conducted a workshop with people with acquired brain injury in order to 
                                        understand their perceptions for such an app and to whom it might be useful.
                                        <br>
                                        During the workshop the participants were asked to create personas of 
                                        people who might need such an application. Based on these personas,
                                        they were asked to provide feedback on the application's usecases and 
                                        its perceived usefulness. Three workshops with one participant each were conducted.

                                    <p>
                                        At the evaluation workshop 8 carers attended took part.
                                        The workshop was divided into two sections. The first was be a pluralistic walkthrough of the app. 
                                        The carers were split into two groups and both groups were presented with the printed 
                                        use-case flow diagrams of the app. For each use-case they were
                                        be asked to annotate the prototypes based on the things they wanted ‘keep’, ‘lose’ or ‘change’. 
                                        “Keep, lose, change”  is an annotation technique for getting feedback on prototypes. 
                                        After their choice on each use-case a discussion was held. 

                                        <br>
                                        The second part of the workshop was a re-design phase where they were asked to change the things 
                                        they didn’t like or they wanted to be changed. Due to time limitations this part was not conducted 
                                        as planned (see “Refine” in Figure 3). Instead a general discussion, which lasted about 10 minutes,
                                         was held. The two groups were discussing about the things they had annotated, and suggested changes
                                          on the problematic parts of each use-case.
                                        
                                        <br>
                                         Moreover, the carers suggested new features for the app.
                                        The session was audio recorded. The audio recordings and the annotated use-case diagrams were 
                                        analysed by the team. The outcome of the analysis was summarised in a list with all the problematic issues.
                                        The list was discussed between the members of the team, and it was sorted based on severity and 
                                        feasibility of implementation. The selected issues were then presented to the development partners in 
                                        order for them to implement them.

                                        All the materials (personas, annotated paper prototypes and audio recordings) gathered during the workshops
                                        were analysed. A list of proposed changes on the designs was compiled and ordered according to their 
                                        importance.
                                        <br>

                                        All the changes were translated to new prototypes in the form of annotated usecase flow diagrams (Figure 5).
                                        These diagrams were given to the IT contractor company and the final system was implemented according to them.
