                                        As part of my Master's Thesis, I designed and developed a mobile phone interface
                                        for older users. 
                                        <br>
                                        The interface was designed so it can be more accessible for elderly users (over 65)
                                        who are not comfortable with technology.
                                        <br>
                                        The interface was covering all the main functionality a mobile phone has
                                        (e.g. main screen, phone calls, messaging, contacts, calendar) and was also
                                        supporting emergency functionality.

                                    <p>
                                        In order to gather the requirements a qualitative
                                        enquiry with 5 potential user was conducted. The 
                                        participants were interviewed through a semi-structured
                                        protocol and were asked about their current usage of
                                        a mobile phones and their needs in relation to a
                                        hand-held device.

                                    <br>
                                    The interviews were analysed and the following requirements arose:

                                            <u>Sense of security</u> - The possession and only, of a mobile phone, creates the sense of security.
                                            Moreover, usability will probably enhance that sense since it will make the users feel more
                                            confident about the use of the phone.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <u>Accessibility</u> - All the design decisions and practices that will make the interface accessible
                                            to every sub-user group eg. Large and visually separated keys and buttons
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <u>Acceptability and Adoption</u> - The interface should provide a clear advantage that would motivate the seniors to widely adopt it
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <u> Customization</u> - The ability of the interface to be tailored according to the users’ needs and
                                            preferences
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <u>Socialise</u> - Increase the social behaviour of users through enhancing communication and
                                            sharing of information
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <u>Autonomy</u> - The interface should help seniors gain their autonomy (not depend on others) and
                                            also increase their sense of security
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <u>Usability</u> - The most essential requirement since it is the summary of all the design decisions
                                            and practices, as it realises the rest of the requirements. It will certainly require reduction of
                                            complexity.

                                            <u>Affordable</u> - The product to be developed should be affordable in order to target the general
                                            seniors’ market

                                        All colour combination was evaluated based on
                                        WCAG2–Level AA  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/"> accessibility specifications </a> by using the 
                                        online <a href="https://accessibility.oit.ncsu.edu/tools/color-contrast/index.php"> Color Palette Accessibility

                                        For size and spacing, the guidelines proposed by Jin et al.[1] were adopted. 
                                        Hence, buttons designed for seniors who have low manual dexterity (measured using a
                                        Pegboard Test[2]) should have a larger button size, at least 19.05 mm and a larger spacing, from
                                        6.35 mm to 12.7 mm.

                                        In order for the users to have an awareness of where they are  throughout the interface [3]
                                        the system status was designed to be visible with the use of a
                                        persistent colour coding. 
                                        Also, headings and icons were at every page of the interface.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Two types of feedback were used throughout the whole interface for enhancing 
                                        the interaction. The first type was visual feedback in 
                                        the form of highlighting.

                                        An accessible by every screen button (“care centre”) was designed.
                                        The care centre page was devoted to emergency situations and provided ability to call an ambulance or
                                        a relative/carer.

                                        The initial prototypes were evaluated through a task-centred think aloud evaluation.
                                        5 university students (between 22 and 32 years old) agreed to take part.
                                        <br>
                                        They were asked to complete 12 tasks and I was taking notes and asking them
                                        questions about their actions during the evaluation.
                                        <br>
                                        Many usability issues were found and redesigned based on the participants' 
                                        feedback (Figure 6).
                                        <br>
                                        All the participants enjoyed interacting with the interface (Figure 7) and perceived it 
                                        as useful for its target user group.

                                        The purpose of this experiment was to understand
                                        if the elderly would be significantly less productive 
                                        using the interface than the younger adults.
                                        <br>
                                        Even though the elderly were expected to be slower
                                        in all tasks (see Figure 7), due to their lack of experience with smartphones,
                                        I wanted to see whether they could achieve analogous results 
                                        as the younger adults.
                                        
                                    </p>

                                        in which the elderly were less productive than the younger (considering
                                        their mean difference in task completion).
