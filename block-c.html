                                    Block-C is an editor for C programming language which uses visual blocks as
                                    for writing programs.
                                    It was created from scratch as part of my undergraduate thesis.
                                    <br>
                                    The problem BLock-C was designed to solve, was the difficulty that first
                                    year students face when are first introduced to C language.
                                    <br>
                                    Block-C was designed to help them focus on the logic of programming
                                    instead of the cumbersome syntax of C.

                                            eliminates syntactic errors. This is accomplished by the use of visual
                                            blocks that make explicit the structure of language expressions.
                                            Furthermore, a restricted sub-grammar is used having only
                                            the necessary to introduce a novice to C programming.

                                    Block-C was evaluated in 3 independent stages;
                                    a think aloud evaluation with novices, a think aloud evaluation with
                                    experts and one final controlled experiment evaluation with 32 novices.
                                    <br>
                                    Between these stages the user interface was refined based on the feedback
                                    of each evaluation.
                                </p>

                                <h5> Initial evaluation with novices</h5>
                                <p>
                                    The goal of this evaluation was to address the novice users’
                                    perspective and identify usability flaws.
                                    <br>
                                    Three university students volunteered to evaluate the interface.
                                    A think-aloud protocol was used and the participants
                                    were asked to accomplish a set of twelve tasks of gradual
                                    difficulty. At the end of the evaluation session the
                                    users completed a questionnaire.
                                    <br>
                                    Some major usability errors and bugs were detected and subsequently solved.
                                    Moreover, the users suggested some extra functionality which was
                                    implemented in the second prototype of the tool.
                                </p>

                                <h5>Evaluation with experts</h5>
                                <p>
                                    The purpose in this stage was to get feedback from
                                    experienced C programming academic teachers.
                                    Three lecturers
                                    from the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of
                                    the Technical University of Crete participated in the experiment.
                                    <br>
                                    The participants were asked to use
                                    Block−C and compose a simple C program. During the
                                    interview they were asked to explain the difference of some
                                    similar syntactic tokens (e.g. assignment operator “=” vs.
                                    equality testing operator “==”) using the block commands. They
                                    were also asked to reflect on how they would explain the
                                    differences of blocks and its connectors to their students.
                                    <br>
                                    The results of this evaluation helped in further discover major
                                    interface problems. Several bugs were detected and fixed, as
                                    well. Furthermore, the users contributed in the addition of extra
                                    functionality.
                                </p>

                                <h5>Final Evaluation of Effectiveness</h5>
                                This stage aimed at evaluating the learning effectiveness of
                                Block−C following controlled group experimentation,
                                with the test group used Block−C while the
                                control group used plain text C.
                                <br>
                                In total 32 first-year students participated.
                                The participants were randomised in control and test group.

                                The first session was introductory and participants of both
                                groups were introduced to the environments used
                                and asked to solve a set of exercises with the help of tutors.
                                <br>
                                The second stage was the actual evaluation and the participants were asked to solve
                                three tasks of increased difficulty in two hours.
                                Four tutors were present to help participants only with
                                significant logical errors and not syntactical.
